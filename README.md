This project is a skeleton for candidate's homework as part of the job application process.

### Requirements ###
The skeleton includes a simple page with an HTML5 video element and placeholders for functionality you will need to implement: 

* Play/Pause toggle functionality
* Progress indication - update the time label as the video plays
* Views counter
* Like/Dislike functionality - click to to update counter

Use [Firebase Realtime Database](https://firebase.google.com/products/realtime-database/) to implement the views and like/dislike across sessions and viewers.

### How do I get set up? ###

* Setup a local dev env (e.g. [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
* Signup for [Firebase](https://www.firebase.com/) free account
* Get the skeleton (clone the repo or simply download as a zip file)
* Deploy the skeleton's files into your dev env
* Start coding!

### Things to consider:

* How to make sure that the UI and video state are sync
* Where is the single source of truth for your data
* How do you make sure the data in the DB is sound even if multiple people are using the voting system at the same time
* How does the project gets packed/bundled (see [webpack](https://webpack.github.io/) or [rollup](https://rollupjs.org/))
* How would you test your functionality (we recommend [Jest](https://jestjs.io/)

### What are we looking for? ###

* Code that works according to the requirements
* Understanding of Javascript fundamentals
* Modular design 
* Attention to detail
* Ability to self learn how to work with new APIs and web services
* Clear, beautiful and properly documented code

Nice to have:

* Make the video controls prettier ([Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) would be highly appreciated)  


### How do I submit? ###

Simply send us a zip file and instructions how to run your project once unpacked
